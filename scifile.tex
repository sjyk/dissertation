Emerging techniques in Deep Reinforcement
Learning (Deep RL) have great potential for sequential decision making problems from robotics to databases. This dissertation studies Deep RL in action spaces that are very high-dimensional and/or combinatorial; requiring new hierarchical frameworks for representing policies and exploration strategies for efficiently pruning the search space. The dissertation describes  Deep RL systems for learning robust surgical robot control policies, synthesizing data-cleaning programs, and generating efficient execution plans for relational queries. To achieve these systems, I make the following algorithmic contributions: a new learning framework for learning hierarchical task structure from observed data and a exploration of applying the Deep Q Network algorithm in combinatorial graph search problems.

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.
