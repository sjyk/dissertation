\begin{sciabstract}
Markov Decision Processes are ubiquitous from problems in robot path planning to cluster task scheduling. 
Policy search in MDPs suffers greatly from the ``curse of dimensionality'' when the space of possible decisions at each time-step is very high-dimensional or when time horizon is very long. 
This main thesis of this dissertation is that it is possible to learn important structural features of an MDP to guid the search process from offline data to significantly improve the sample-efficiency, stability, and robustness of solutions even with high dimensional action spaces and long time horizons.
It presents applications to surgical robot control, data cleaning, and generating efficient execution plans for relational queries. 
The dissertation contributes: (1) Sequential Windowed Reinforcement Learning: a framework that approximates a long-horizon MDP with a sequence of shorter term MDPs with smooth quadratic cost functions from a small number of expert demonstrations, (2) Deep Discovery of Options: an algorithm that discovers hierarchical structure in the action space from observed demonstrations, (3) AlphaClean: a system that decomposes a data cleaning task into a set of independent search problems and uses deep q-learning to share structure across the problems, and (4) Learning Query Optimizer: a system that observes executions of a dynamic program for SQL query optimization and learns a model to predict cost-to-go values to greatly speed up future search problems.

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.
